## 🎯 Challenge

The proposal was to develop an app to manage orders in a restaurant to a tablet interface, using React.JS and consuming the [API](https://lab-api-bq.herokuapp.com/api-docs/). The project was developed in groups of two people during four sprints of one week. To know more about the challenge click [here](https://github.com/Laboratoria/SAP005-burger-queen).

## 💡 About
Burgerlicious is a fast-food chain that works for 24 hours. Due to its success and expansion, the chain needs a system to improve the management of orders, making easy the communication between the employees in the hall and the kitchen. 

The interface must present two types of menu, breakfast and all-day, detailing the products. The waiter and waitress have to create the customer's order, view in real-time the summary with the final price to pay, then send it to the kitchen. In turn, the kitchen staff has to notify them when the orders are ready to be served.

## 💻 Development

### 📋 Planning

This project was developed under demand, we receive four user's stories defined by the Product Owner. From that, we follow the Kanban model to [planning](https://trello.com/b/iATzyG7R/burgerlicious-%F0%9F%8D%94) and developing one user story per sprint. In total, we develop four stories in four sprints of one week. The strategy adopted to write the code was to make a code review.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./src/img/burger-anatomy.png"></img>
  <img alt="color-palette" title="#color-palette" src="./src/img/color-palette.svg"></img>
</p>

#### Logo

The chosen logo composes with the fun aesthetic that pastel tones bring to the brand and was developed by [Icons8](https://icons8.com/vector-creator/), made only a few changes by the authors.

<p align="center">
    <img width="350" src="./src/img/logo.png"></img>
</p>

#### Typography

It was used [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?) as the family font and the icons of [Material Design](https://material.io/) in the app. 

#### Prototype

The prototypes were developed prioritizing the tablet interface since was one of the requirements of the challenge. Besides that, we model [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/proto/VE1qAvPVorjSDtMrSbGmBr/BurguerIicious?node-id=27%3A3175&scaling=scale-down) and apply a usability test on this face to investigate how the *Create Order* feature could work in the best way. To see all the interface models click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/VE1qAvPVorjSDtMrSbGmBr/BurguerIicious?node-id=28%3A1381).

### 🕵️‍♀️ Usability test

We apply usability tests using the low fidelity prototype and, then, as user's stories were concluded. The improvement points were:

&nbsp;
❌ The user missed knowing which form field was mandatory.

&nbsp;
✔️ Every form field has the title and the symbol * (known as a mandatory field) and the example of the info format.
##

&nbsp;
❌ The user did not understand the logout symbol used in the wireframe model.

&nbsp;
✔️ We change the icon and use also information in a text.
##

&nbsp;
❌ The user would like to change the product's quantity in the order summary to avoid having to come back in the menu section and save some clicks. 

&nbsp;
✔️ We put two buttons, minus and plus, to update the product quantity in the order summary.
##

&nbsp;
❌ The user would like to view which burger options were selected before adding in the order.

&nbsp;
✔️ We change the color of the items as they were selected.
##

&nbsp;
❌ The user missed receiving a message confirming that the order was sent successfully to the kitchen. 
 
&nbsp;
✔️ We add micro-interactions that send messages to the user when one action is canceled, concluded with success or unsuccessful.

##

### 🚧 Future implementations

- [ ] Notify in real-time hall and kitchen staff, without the need to refresh the page.
- [ ] Allow making comments about the order.
- [ ] Implement a self-attend service.
